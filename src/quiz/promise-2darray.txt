Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

- First, the main loop executes ("sum called ...", "returning from sum" )

- then, once the result is handled, the asynchronous thread runs (after setTimeout())
    - first error caught: ("BAD INPUT")
    - then response resolved ("resolving ...")

- Finally the result is returned ("45")
